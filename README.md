# Infrastructure-as-Code templates for IT-engineers

Ready-to-deploy community templates for Ansible, Terraform, SaltStack, Docker & Kubernetes for quick launch of popular infrastructure services - on bare metal, in VMs and containers.

Our goal is to maintain a shared, well-documented production-ready setup library to get rid of sysadmins, DevOps, SRE routine where possible.

### Why we do it

- **Save time** - No more writing boilerplate configs for infrastructure services
- **Reduce drift and risks** - Enforce consistency across environments, make changes more predictable
- **Scale faster** - Modular templates adapt to your needs, whether deploying a single server or distributed system
